Name of the Project:
Shark Tank!

Overview of the project:
This project was a fun little app to practice React skills. I have a simple shark tank where my classmates are swimming with the sharks! A Chum Time button randomly selects a person that gets eaten by a shark and moves to the "Sinkers" graveyard. Watch out for Bruce!

Link to your wireframes/prototype:
Did this one old school on a piece of paper! Coming soon...

Description of the user:
My Shark Tank user is a person looking to check in on my coding progress or a lover of swimming with sharks!!

List of features:
This app is growing but already has a colorful screen and a funcitonal random selector button that switches cards to a new section. I also added a fun animation of Bruce the shark that floats by in the tank.
